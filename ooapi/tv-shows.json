    "summary": "<p><b>The Sopranos</b>, writer-producer-director David Chase's extraordinary television series, is nominally an urban gangster drama, but its true impact strikes closer to home: Like 1999's other screen touchstone, American Beauty, the HBO series chronicles a dysfunctional, suburban American family in bold relief. And for protagonist Tony Soprano, there's the added complexity posed by heading twin families, his collegial mob clan and his own, nouveau riche brood.</p>",

In Seasons Two and Three, as the Barksdale investigation escalated, new storylines involving pressures on the working class and the city's political leadership were introduced. Season Four focused on the stories of several young boys in the public school system, struggling with problems at home and the lure of the corner - set against the rise of a new drug empire in West Baltimore and a new Mayor in City Hall. The fifth and final season of <i>The Wire</i> centers on the media's role in addressing - or failing to address - the fundamental political, economic and social realities depicted over the course of the series, while also resolving storylines of the numerous characters woven throughout the narrative arc of the show.</p>",

McNulty recognises drug king-pin Stringer Bell in the court room and believes he has manipulated the proceedings, so he circumvents the chain-of-command by talking to the judge, Daniel Phelan, who then places pressure on the police department to investigate the Barksdale drug-dealing organization, which, McNulty claims, has gotten away with ten murders in the last year. D'Angelo is welcomed home by his uncle, Barksdale patriarch, Avon, who is frustrated with him for placing himself in a situation where the police could charge him. Nevertheless, Avon allows him to return to work, but in what D'Angelo sees as a demotion, he is moved to a low-rise housing project known as \"the pit.\" Meanwhile, homeless drug addict Bubbles, acts as mentor to another addict, Johnny Weeks, in an ill-conceived scam with severe consequences.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Julia Davis heads an impressive cast in <b>Nighty Night</b>, a dark comedy/drama series which she also wrote. The series could be described as a West Country version of Fatal Attraction. It centres on Jill, a woman with an obsession, who is the co-owner of a suburban beauty salon. She has other things on her mind, though, namely the handsome doctor who lives in the house opposite with his wife, a wheelchair user. Jill claims her hospitalised husband is dying of a terminal illness and so descends on the life of the unfortunate couple and refuses to leave. The series won a Banff Award and Davis won a Royal Television Society Award for her performance and got a highly positive reception from TV critics.</p>",

On Earth, Vegeta, Whis, and the others are still standing by, watching the battle. Whis is surprised by the Super Saiyan God's power and its ability to keep up with his trainee. In space, Goku struggles to keep up with Beerus' attack, which ultimately ends up in a massive explosion, blinding everyone on Earth. Shortly after, the light clears out, revealing everything to be as it was prior to the explosion. Beerus explains that he used his full power to negate the explosion, thereby saving the Universe. Seeing it as a perfect opportunity to boast, Mr. Satan arranges to have him be falsely credited with saving the planet yet again. Despite being at his limit, Goku remains calm, which annoys the God of Destruction. Beerus thinks Goku might have a strategy that he has been hiding which Goku promptly denies, saying that everything he had been doing was improvised as they fought. The Gods quickly power up and continue fighting, but this time, both at their limit. However, as soon as they start, Goku loses his Super Saiyan God aura, reverting to the ordinary Super Saiyan form. Upon noticing that, Beerus decides to quit, thinking it is pointless to fight an ordinary Saiyan. Goku, however, does not notice and keeps going at it. Able to sense Goku's energy, Whis assumes that the battle has concluded and that Goku lost, but Piccolo begs to differ. Surprised that Goku is still able to hit him even after losing his God form, Beerus surmises that Goku's body has adjusted to the Super Saiyan God power, making him stronger in his ordinary form. Goku proclaims that, with or without the Super Saiyan God form, it is still him that Beerus is up against, and the two resume their battle.</p>",

Meanwhile, all of Universe 7's remaining warriors except Master Roshi and No. 17 gather at the Capsule Corporation. After Krillin brings up the 10 million Zeni prize that Goku had bribed him, 18, and Tien with, Piccolo and Gohan reveal that the prize of 10 million Zeni was a lie and that the universe will be destroyed if they lose. When Goku returns, Krillin berates him and threatens to withdraw from the team along with No. 18. After Goku fails to convince them otherwise, Beerus swiftly threatens Krillin into staying, while Bulma agrees to pay out the promised reward. In Universe 6, Cabba takes Caulifla to a deserted wasteland to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. As Caulifla's protégée, Kale(ケール<i>Kēru</i>), observes them, Cabba ineffectually attempts to provoke Caulifla in order to make her transform. When that fails, he teaches her to focus her energy on an area in her back. Caulifla successfully transforms into a Super Saiyan. Caulifla tests her newfound power and agrees to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power. Caulifla beckons Kale over to attempt the transformation herself. In Universe 11, Kahseral arrives at the Pride Trooper headquarters, where he and Toppo agree to leave the universe in their trainees' hands so they can participate in the tournament. In Universe 3, two cyborg warriors named Nigrisshi(ニグリシ<i>Nigrisshi</i>)and Narirama(ナリラマ<i>Narirama</i>)display their upgrades for the tournament to Universe 3's deities Mosco(モスコ<i>Mosuko</i>), Ea(エア), and Campari(カンパーリ<i>Kanpāri</i>). Back in Universe 7, Goku and his friends are unable to figure out who can replace Buu. When Beerus claims they have no suitable fighters because Goku destroyed the Frieza Force, Goku is inspired to recruit Frieza, which shocks everyone.</p>",

Lois is Peter's wife, a stay-at-home mom with no patience for her family's antics. Then there are their kids: 18-year-old Meg is an outcast at school and the Griffin family punching bag; 13-year-old Chris is a socially awkward teen who doesn't have a clue about the opposite sex; and one-year-old Stewie is a diabolically clever baby whose burgeoning sexuality is very much a work in progress. Rounding out the Griffin household is Brian the family dog and a ladies' man who is one step away from AA.</p>",

Then he accidentally leaves his hair dryer by his pants, which inflates them, giving him the buoyancy to fly. He then goes around helping people, earning their admiration, but others start requesting increasingly unnecessary favors, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish.</p><p>The episode opens with Patchy the Pirate in a live-action segment, lamenting that he lost his VHS copy and setting off to find it using a treasure map. (To promote the episode, Nickelodeon launched an on-air campaign called \"SpongeBob's Lost Episode\".) But when he finally recovers it, the tape only shows a clip of SpongeBob walking in cycles to techno music before abruptly ending with color bars. Patchy gets angry, thinking that SpongeBob betrayed him, and gets rid of all his SpongeBob merchandise, after which the real animated episode start playing.</p><p>In 2007, this episode was adapted into a musical called \"SpongeBob SquarePants Live! The Sponge Who Could Fly!\"</p>",

    "summary": "<p><i><b>\"Total Drama Action\"</b></i> is the second season of the Canadian animated television series Total Drama Island. The show premiered in Teletoon Canada 6:30 et/pt[2] on January 11, 2009. This series was also created by the makers of 6Teen, another Teletoon program. Like its predecessor, Total Drama Island, this season's series is an \"animated reality show\" starring fifteen teenagers. This series still portrays likeliness towards other physical and social shows, like Fear Factor and The Real World. The original twenty-two \"campers\" were cut down to fifteen \"cast-mates\" after the reunion special's dramatic ending between these seasons. Both host and assistant Chris McClean and Chef Hatchet will return as the cast-mates' supervisors and challenge distributors. The theme of this series is \"Cinematography\".</p>",
